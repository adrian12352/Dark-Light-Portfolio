### What I learned

I learned basic css flexbox and grid properties to convert a simple portfolio in a fully responsive website. I learned how to use scrollreveal js library to provide a better UI experience

### Useful resources

- [ScrollRevealjs](https://scrollrevealjs.org/) - This helped me to animate elements as they enter/leave the viewport
- [softr.io](https://www.softr.io/tools/javascript-scroll-to-top-button) - Using this generator, I implement the scroll-up button that appears when you scroll down the page.
- [Dark/Light Theme feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LZGB3OLXNQ&t=343s) - This video taught me how to add the light and dark theme to my website
